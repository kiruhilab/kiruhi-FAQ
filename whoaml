## 👋 Who am I?

Hey, I'm Koray — a 17-year-old from Tekirdağ, Turkey, and the founder of Kiruhi.  
My goal is simple: financial freedom through code and smart systems.

Hobbies:  
- Coding (Python, JS, AI automations)  
- Meditation  
- Gaming (Minecraft & Roblox — especially Shindo Life)  
- Drawing  
- Reading (favorite: Atomic Habits by James Clear)  
- Walking

This repo is my testing ground for sharing real tools, scripts, and knowledge to help you build and win too.  
Let's grow together.
